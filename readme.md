### SWOT Analysis

### Professional Development Plan
- **Technical Proficiency** continue to uphold this standard
- **Industry Knowledge** Stay abreast of industry news. Proactively work with customers (security professionals) and crossfunctional coworkers (cyber analysts) to build literacy in the area. Continue my studies in the field.
- **Compliance and Ethics** continue to uphold this standard
- **Communication** Work on procatively sharing what I'm working on to a wider audience. 
- **Collaboration** Seek projects that require me to work with sister teams more often. Practice managing regular checkins and pair programming sessions.
