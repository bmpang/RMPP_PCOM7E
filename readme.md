### SWOT Analysis
#### **Strengths**

1. **Technical Mastery**:
    - Expert-level ability to design secure systems and write new software.
2. **Communication & Leadership**:
    - Ability to articulate risks to leadership and mentor peers effectively with regards to compliance and development.

#### **Weaknesses**

1. **Threat Analysis**:
    - Limited domain knowledge.
    - Not as experienced proactive defense strategies (e.g., zero-day mitigation) as opposed to reactive.
2. **Collaboration**:
    - Opportunity to work on collaborating with different business personas at different stages in the SDLC.

#### **Opportunities**

1. **Research**:
    - Previously awarded a patent in network security, it would be good to do more novel work outside of normal duties.
2. **Industry Collaboration**:
    - Try contributing to an open source project to enhance collaboration skills and potentially work in novel research as per above.

#### **Threats**

1. **Rapid Threat Evolution**:
    - New attacks and actors may outpace development of current intermediate threat knowledge.
2. **Regulatory Changes (especially as a result of global industrial shifts)**:
    - Shifting compliances (e.g. EU AI Act) require continuous learning.
3. **Competition**:
    - Peers that have careers more entrenched in cyber security will have a leg up in experience and knowledge

### Professional Development Plan

- **Technical Proficiency** continue to uphold this standard
- **Industry Knowledge** Stay abreast of industry news. Proactively work with customers (security professionals) and crossfunctional coworkers (cyber analysts) to build literacy in the area. Continue my studies in the field.
- **Compliance and Ethics** continue to uphold this standard
- **Communication** Work on procatively sharing what I'm working on to a wider audience. 
- **Collaboration** Seek projects that require me to work with sister teams more often. Practice managing regular checkins and pair programming sessions.
